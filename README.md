 This game is an RTS-style zombie infection game where you must conquer the enemy kingdom of humans while protecting the Alpha Zombie.
 The Alpha is a distinct zombie capable of killing the enemy, as well as calling for reinforcements.

 You are the Alpha Zombie. It is your duty to amass the horde and overthrow the ruler of the land.
 But be warned, the greater the horde becomes, the greater the threat to your un-life.
 The ruler will not stand for the hordeâ€™s attacks, so you better expect countermeasures.
 This will only end in one of two ways, either the ruler joins the horde or you cease to exist.
